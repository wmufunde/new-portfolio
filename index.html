             <p>  I am a web developer from Croydon, London. I have a passion for the creative, with eclectic taste for development and design. My primary language is Python, though I also have interests in Ruby and Java </p>
             
             <p> I got my first taste of programming studying Computer Science at Kent University, and fell in love with web development. I was taught the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP, and discovered a new world of possibilities. Unfortunatley I was unable to finish the course due to circumstances out of my control. But I was determiened to be a programmer, and so I found another route to my goal. </p>
             
             <p>Unwilling to give up, I decided to embark on a self funded course that fit around my schedule. I am currently undertaking the Development Professional Programming course with Just IT in London</p>

                  I have had a keen interest in Software Engineering since my A-Level IT course in which I had to create a database system in Microsoft Access for my client, a music receptionist. Using an in-depth level of analysis and creativity, I had to interpret my client's user requirements by taking into consideration their available technology such as hardware and software, and their expertise.

              <p> A web development and databases module taught me to programme in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL. </p>
              <p> The Human Interaction module was particularly interesting because it explained the theory behind successful designing. </p>
              <p> I have competent skills in Java (I achieved 81% in an Object Orientated Programming module). </p>
              <p> People and Computing and Human Computer Interaction modules comprised of two separate team projects, from design to the Lo-Fi prototype. </p>
              <p> These enabled me to liaise and collaborate with other team members. The modules taught the principles of successful designing, focussing on user-centred approach techniques such as the Heuristics Evaluation.</p>
